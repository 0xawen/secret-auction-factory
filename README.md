# Sealed Bid Auction Factory
I'm updating the sealed bid auction so that auctions are spawned by a factory contract.  This enables you to do queries to just list the active auctions (or just the closed auctions), as well as list only the auctions you are the seller in, have active bids in, or won.  Also, you will set your viewing key with the factory, and it automatically sets that same key for all your active auctions.

There is still a lot of testing I want to do, but I thought I'd put it out there early so anyone that is building a UI, can get a feel for what has changed.  Ignore all the temp logs that are being used for debugging...
